# Interesting_Papers_MobileComputing

## Introduction

This repository collects interesting papers in mobile computing area starting from 2022. We mainly focus on following conferences: **MobiCom**, **UbiComp**, **MobiSys**, **SenSys**, **MobiHoc**, **INFOCOM**, **ICDCS**. Currently, selected papers focus on **acoustic sensing** (acoustic/sound/speech/voice/ultrasonic/microphone/speaker), **federated learning** (federated) and **cross-modality** (model/modal/cross/multi).
